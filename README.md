# femtohs - Finite Element Toolkit for Haskell

A practically oriented finite element toolkit to help build solvers for different kinds of partial differential equations.

## Hopes and dreams:
 - offer a library which is importable to e.g. IHaskell kernel.
 - extensible
 - general
 - performing well enough for serious computations but still...
 - elegant
 - co-operates well and efficiently with existing tools (e.g. GMSH for geometry/mesh generation/visualization)
